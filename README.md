<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As IT students and young citizens, we really believe in technology as a solution for the ecology matter. Based on this, we decided to participate in a students-only hackathon organised by the [CSLabs](https://cslabs.be) here in Belgium which topic's was [Hope for Climate](https://hackathon.cslabs.be/).

We decided to build **Choose your Path**, an Android mobile game that educates people by making them aware of the consequences of their own actions on the environment.

This application has also won the first price for the technical aspect which makes us really happy!
